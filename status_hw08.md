3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
events.rohitpathak.us


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
Everything is complete except generating a link for the invite to send to invitees. The invitees can still get to the event and do all the functionality for replying, but I didn't get time to generate the actual link to send to invitees.

Yes, it is properly deployed.
